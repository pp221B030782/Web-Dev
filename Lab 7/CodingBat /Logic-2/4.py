  Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is 
  a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, 
  except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper 
  "def fix_teen(n):" that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed 
  for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times 
  (i.e. "decomposition").
